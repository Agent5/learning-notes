I'm constructing this repo to save all of my notes from learning various topics (listing below).

1. [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
2. [CSS (the tricky parts)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)
3. [JavaScript (it's all tricky parts)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
4. [AngularJS (whoooo!!!)](https://angularjs.org/)
